Kill the Cat
----------------------

Kill the Cat is a mini game, based off the famous franchise Plants vs. Zombies, which puts players in a battle with stray cats. It is inspired by real events at New York University Abu Dhabi, where so-called campus cats would attempt to steal people's food near the dining hall. To prevent this CATastrophe, players must collect coins and purchase students (who would throw plates at the cats) or water sprayers (which would chase the cat away for a while).<br>
